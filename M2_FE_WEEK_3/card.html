      <h2>PENGUINS</h2>
      <p>
        Penguins are fascinating birds that cannot fly but are excellent
        swimmers. They live mainly in the Southern Hemisphere, especially in
        Antarctica, and are well adapted to cold environments. Their black and
        white feathers provide camouflage in the ocean, protecting them from
        predators.

      <h2>ELEPHANTS</h2>
      <p>
        Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth. They are known for
        their long trunks, large ears, and thick gray skin. Elephants use their
        trunks for many tasks, such as eating, drinking, and communicating with
        other elephants. They live in herds, usually led by an older female
        called a matriarch. Elephants are herbivores, feeding on grass, fruits,
        and tree bark. They are intelligent and social animals, capable of
        showing emotions like joy, grief, and compassion.

      <h2>RHINOCEROSES</h2>
      <p>
        Rhinoceroses, or rhinos, are large herbivorous mammals known for their
        thick skin and one or two horns on their noses. They live in parts of
        Africa and Asia, usually in grasslands and savannas. Rhinos eat mostly
        plants, such as grass, leaves, and fruits. Despite their size and
        strength, many species of rhinos are endangered because of illegal
        hunting and habitat loss. These animals play an important role in their
        ecosystems by shaping the land and helping plants grow.
